The midterm will be held in class on Thursday, March 9.

The midterm will include (and will be limited to) *all* the material covered in class so far. In particular, you should be thoroughly comfortable with the questions that have been given on the quizzes or assigned for homework so far.

Moreover, you are **strongly** encouraged to practice for the exam by solving the following "extra practice problems":

<ul>
  <li><a href="8-MT1probs/MT1ExtraPractice.pdf" style="color: blue">Extra practice problems (some with answers).</a></li>
</ul>

(It should not come as a surprise if a problem similar to any one of these "extra practice" problems shows up on the midterm.)

Good luck!
