    "While lists associate numerical indices, starting at zero with an order sequence of elements, dictionaries map names to values. Here, names is actually a little more general than strings. Numbers work just fine and, in general, any Python object that is hashable may be used as a name. Hashable means that Python can convert it to a number. That's true for many types of objects. What we're going to review in this movie is how to create Python dictionaries, known as dicts, how to look at the individual elements, how to merge dictionaries, and how to loop over dictionaries in a few different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, dictionaries are denoted by curly braces with items separated by commas. Each item consists of a key (in this example, a country) and a value (in this example, the name of its capital).\n"
