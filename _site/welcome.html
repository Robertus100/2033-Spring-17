<p>Welcome to your first CIS 2033 class! We’ll get to know each other, talk about
what to expect from the course, and briefly discuss administrative matters. We’ll
then jump straight into course material.</p>

<p>Two features make this run of the course different from the previous versions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All programming assignments will be done in <code class="highlighter-rouge">python</code> (no need to worry if
  you have not programmed in python before: you’ll pick it up as we go along).</li>
  <li>After the midterm, a significant portion of this course will be devoted to
Bayesian statistics and some of its applications, and there will be a hands-on project
based on this material.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a link to the <a href="https://david-dobor.github.io/2033Fall16/" title="Fall 16 version of the course">previous version (Fall ‘16)</a> of the course.</p>

<p>Lecture slides, links to useful resources, homework and project assignments
and other course related material will be posted here after each lecture.</p>

<p>Let’s have a great semester!</p>
