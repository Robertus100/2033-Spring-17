    "You have two bowls of cookies. \n",
    "* Bowl 1 contains 30 vanilla cookies and 10 chocolate cookies. \n",
    "* Bowl 2 contains 20 of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose you choose one of the bowls at random and, without looking, select a cookie at random. The cookie is vanilla. What is the probability that it came from Bowl 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "So we want the conditional probability \n",
    "$$P( \\ \\text{Bowl 1} \\mid  \\text{Vanilla}\\ )$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, take moment to solve this problem using the Bayes theorem we discussed in class (which would also be a good practice for the quiz to be given later today).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're done, we'll use a function from the Think Bayes book to obtain the same same answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library of functions we need are stored in files `thinkbayes2.py` and `thinkplot.py`, both of which can be found on the following page https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkBayes2/tree/master/code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding, download these two files and save them in the same directory from which you're running your `ipython` notebook."
