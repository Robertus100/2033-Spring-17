    "In Python programming, especially when you're dealing with data, there are many cases where you want to iterate over list or dict, perform an operation on every element, and then collect all the results in a new list or dict. You can certainly do that with a For Loop, but Python offers a great feature, comprehensions, that lets you write shorter and clearer code that achieves the same effect. In this movie, we're going to review how to write loops as comprehensions, how to apply them only to select items, and how to do the same for lists and for dicts."

The result is the same, but we have skipped the intermediate step of creating the list before feeding the values to the sum. If you're dealing with lots and lots of data, this can save a lot of memory and time. I cannot stress how incredible useful comprehensions are. In many programming problems, all that you're doing is creating and manipulating lists and dictionaries."
