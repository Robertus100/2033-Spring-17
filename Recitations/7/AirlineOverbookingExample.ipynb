    "### Homework 8, Question 4 \n",
    "\n",
    "For any given flight, an airline tries to\n",
    "sell as many tickets as possible. Suppose that on average, 10% of ticket\n",
    "holders fail to show up, all independent of one another. Knowing this, an\n",
    "airline will sell more tickets than there are seats available (i.e., overbook\n",
    "the flight) and hope that there is a sufficient number of ticket holders who\n",
    "do not show up to compensate for its overbooking. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Central Limit Theorem, determine $n$, the maximum number of\n",
    "tickets an airline should sell on a flight with 300 seats so that it can be\n",
    "approximately 99% confident that all ticket holders who do show up will\n",
    "be able to board the plane. Use the 1/2-correction we discussed in class in\n",
    "your calculations.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Let $n$ be the number of tickets the airline sells.\n",
    "+ Let $X_i$ be the Bernoulli random variable indicating whether the $i$-th ticket holder shows up. \n",
    "+ We are given that $p$, the probability that the $i$-th ticket holder shows up, is $p = {\\bf P} (X_i = 1) = 0.9$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then $S_n = X_1 + X_2 + \\ldots + X_n$ is a binomial random variable with mean $n \\cdot p = 0.9 \\cdot n$ and standard deviation of $\\sqrt{n \\cdot 0.9 \\cdot 0.1} = 0.3\\sqrt{n}$\n",
